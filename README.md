For more comprehensive advice on how to use Analysis.py please refer to the README.docx which has screenshots.

To be able to run Analysis.py you will need to download the Analysis.py file and the IRIScsv.csv file from my github https://github.com/g00387822/pands-project

Both the Analysis.py file and the IRIScsv.csv file will need to be saved in the same directory.
If you don’t already have python installed you will need to download version 3.7 or later from https://www.python.org/downloads/
While installing Python it is very important to tick the option to add Python to PATH. 


SETTING PYTHON UP TO RUN ANALYSIS.PY
Located at the top of the source code of most python programs are a list of modules that the application uses.

Before you run Analysis.py PIP INSTALLS may need to get the above modules to work. In the event of errors, check the source code to see which modules need to be installed.
Generally a PIP install has to be done for any module used in the application that isn’t installed on your computer / version of Python. If the Python application isn’t loading when double clicked or run from your python editor, you will need to do PIP installs from the command prompt.
Here are examples of pip installs that you will need to do for any module not found error for this application. Get the name of module from module not found error and pip install it from your command prompt on windows of mac terminal.
e.g. pip install colorama, pip install PIL, pip install pandas, pip install matplotlib, pip install seaborn

With PIP installs all done, to activate Analysis.py you should simply be able to double click on the file and Python will run it automatically, alternatively you can run it from Python editor of your choice such as IDLE or Visual Studio Code.
